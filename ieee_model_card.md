### Training Metrics

| Epoch | Train Loss | Validation Loss | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | Accuracy |
|-------|------------|-----------------|-----------|--------|----------|----------|
| 0 | 0.3771 | 0.1228 | 0.8400 | 0.8644 | 0.8520 | 0.9655 |
| 1 | 0.1172 | 0.0962 | 0.8715 | 0.9001 | 0.8856 | 0.9725 |
| 2 | 0.0801 | 0.0895 | 0.8805 | 0.9112 | 0.8956 | 0.9745 |
| 3 | 0.0753 | 0.0881 | 0.8820 | 0.9122 | 0.8972 | 0.9757 |
| 4 | 0.0501 | 0.0883 | 0.8840 | 0.9160 | 0.9011 | 0.9787 |

## Pruning Process
The model underwent a layer-based pruning process to reduce its size while maintaining performance:

1. Original model size: 6.60 GB
2. Pruned model size: 4.71 GB
3. Size reduction: 28.6%

The pruning algorithm prioritized keeping input-adjacent and output-adjacent layers while selectively removing middle layers based on their estimated importance, as these typically contribute less to model performance.
