## Conclusion

The final-merged-model3-pruned.safetensors model demonstrates significant performance improvements over BERT-base-uncased across all evaluated metrics. While the model is substantially larger, the performance gains may justify the increased size for applications where accuracy is critical.

The pruning process has likely helped reduce the model's size from its original form while maintaining high performance, suggesting an effective trade-off between model size and accuracy.

For IEEE paper publication, the visualizations clearly demonstrate the performance advantages of our model and provide compelling evidence of its improvements over the baseline BERT architecture.
